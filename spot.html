  <h1>The SPOT System</h1>
  <h2>Self Positioning Orbital Technology</h2>
  <b>The world is in need of reliable technology that works in Earth's orbit. That's why I'm working on the SPOT System.</b>
  <p>The SPOT Hive: A mobile port for storage and charging of SPOT Bees.</p>
  <p>The SPOT Bee: A first-of-its-kind autonomous drone, capable of repairing satellites, providing data, and adjusting orbiting objects. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The SPOT Bee is general-use. It is a drone platform capable of any assignment, with opportunities for modification to preform specialized tasks.</li>
    <li>The SPOT Bee is autonomous. It doesn't require a connection to Earth to complete its assignment.</li>
    <li>The SPOT Bee is cheap. Due to its longlasting nature and small size, repairing a satellite with the Bee is far cheaper than replacing it.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Current Status: Conceptual design. Prototyping and testing planned.</p>
